            <h2>About Me & My Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Cezar Chiru, an embedded Linux engineer with 4 years of professional experience, from Romania,
                specializing in the Yocto Project. I've built custom distributions, created complex
                BSP layers, and optimized build times for large-scale projects.
            </p>
	    <p>I started my professional life in March 2015 as a contractor for Wind River Systems in Romania as a Software Integrarion Engineer in Automotive IVI (In-Vehicle-Infotainment) Linux systems focusing on using Yocto to create custom BSPs for a custom hardware. In July 2017 I moved to Intel Romania same as a Software Integration Engineer with a determined period contract, where I still worked with Yocto in Automotive IVI Linux systems until my contract ended at the end of the year 2018 (31st December 2018). Due to my illness which I will talk next I had to put my life on hold.</p>
	    <p>I suffer from a psychiatric medical condition called schizo-affective disorder combined with depression. From 2017-2024 I struggled with this disorder, tried different medical treatments with no success. I had to put my life on hold for this period of time so I haven't been working since. I haven't gotten out of the house also since then. I know that it sounds I reject making connections to people but I can assure you I am 100% dedicated to helping other peoplewith my professional expertise.</p>
	    <p>Since 2024 Jan-February I found a treatment which allows me to focus and have a kind of a normal life. Since I weigh 155 kg I cannot move to other countries, cities or get out the house since I get tired very fast. That's why I can offer only remote expertise.</p>
	    <p>Why I am willing to do this for free, you might ask? Since I got better I have been trying to look for remote work roles as an Embedded Linux Engineer with focus on Yocto, development and others. I offered to work as a volunteer or pro bono or not-paid services to about 100 companies on several seniority roles. Even junior roles. I was rejected  or didn't heard back from the companies, probably because of the 7 years gap in my resume. So, doing Yocto consultancy for free for several years, would allow me to gain experience and put that pro bono work in my resume, hoping that I will manage in the end to get a job. In the future, if I get a job I will still offer my assistance for free to anyone as my free time allows me.</p>
            <p>
                I am offering <strong>free consultancy</strong> to help give back to the
                community and to gain more experience. Whether you're a hobbyist stuck on a build error or a professional
                looking for a second opinion or a company seeking consultancy for free, I'm here to help.
            </p>
